     Many of the same features that make Goldens such desirable hunting dogs also make them naturally athletic.
     <br>Their broad heads, powerful necks, and muscular bodies make them extremely strong and highly energetic.<br>
     They also have stamina to spare.<br> Goldens love to chase and catch—and they are mighty good at it.<br>
     But all this athleticism means Golden Retrievers need exercise—and lots of it—on a daily basis.

     <p> According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), Golden Retrievers are intelligent, friendly and devoted. <br>
         These members of the Sporting Group have a life span of 12-14 years.<br>
         They are outgoing, loyal, playful and easy to train.<br>
         With all of that going for them, it’s no surprise that Golden Retrievers are so popular and why they are the Bil-Jac Breed of the Month for July.
