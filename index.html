     Many of the same features that make Goldens such desirable hunting dogs also make them naturally athletic.
     <br>Their broad heads, powerful necks, and muscular bodies make them extremely strong and highly energetic.<br>

     <p> Golden Retrievers are intelligent, friendly and devoted. <br>
         They are outgoing, loyal, playful and easy to train.<br>
         With all of that going for them, itâ€™s no surprise that Golden Retrievers are so
         popular and why they are the Bil-Jac Breed of the Month for July.
